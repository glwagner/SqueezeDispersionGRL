This well-written and clear paper presents a discussion of a new physical process: "squeeze dispersion", which may lead to substantial increases in diapycnal diffusivity due to diapycnal strain. 
This is a very interesting insight, and the potential significance of this process is shown in the specific example of flow through the Samoan Passage. 
This is just the sort of paper which should be published in GRL, and I strongly support acceptance. 
My only significant comment is that I think the authors should expand their discussion somewhat of their reasoning (on line 200) for why "squeeze dispersion is not shear dispersion". 
I agree that it is not, but a somewhat more detailed explanation would make the paper even more convincing. 
I am confident that there will be significant interest in this paper in the future, and overall I find it very clear and well-argued.
